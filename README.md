🩺 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict diseases based on user health data using Machine Learning algorithms. It leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification models to build an accurate prediction system. The project is implemented and executed in Google Colab.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization).

Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations and insights).

Implementation of multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN).

Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Interactive disease prediction system.

⚙️ Installation & Usage

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/DataDruid-09/Disease_Predication.git
cd Disease_Predication

2️⃣ Open in Google Colab

Upload the project folder to your Google Drive.

Open Disease_Prediction.ipynb in Google Colab.

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Run the following inside Colab:
!pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

4️⃣ Run the Notebook

Execute all cells step by step.

Train and evaluate machine learning models.

Use the prediction function to test new health data.

📊 Example Workflow

Load dataset → Preprocess → Split data.

Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Compare accuracy and select best-performing model.

Predict disease from user-input symptoms or health data.

📈 Results

Achieved high accuracy on multiple test cases.

Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed best for classification.

Visualization of disease occurrence trends available in notebook.
